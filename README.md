# Dirichlet task for Puasson's equation with Seidel method
## Build && Run
To build application simply follow a few steps:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
To run under `linux` use:
```bash
./application/seidel.exe
```

To run under `windows` use:
```bash
.\application\seidel.exe
```
## Seidel Method
In case of this method you can solve System of equtions like Ax=b, there:  
    * A - is a coeficent's matrix:  
    * x - is a unknown members column  
    * b - is acolumn of the free members  
## Current task
```
du = - sin(pi*x*y)^2  
x, y —ç (0,1)  
u(0,y) = sin(pi*y)   u(1,y) = sin(pi*y)  
u(x,0) = x - x^2    u(x,0) = x - x^2  
```
