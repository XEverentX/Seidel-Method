# Dirichlet task for Puasson's equation with Seidel method
## Seidel Method
In case of this method you can solve System of equtions like Ax=b, there:  
    A - is a coeficent's matrix:  
    x - is a unknown members column  
    b - is acolumn of the free members  
## Build && Run
To build application simply follow a few steps:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
To run on `Windows` use:
```bash
.\build\application\seidel.exe
```
